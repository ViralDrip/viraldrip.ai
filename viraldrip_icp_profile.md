## Ideal Customer Profile

### Demographics

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Platform | Skool community owners |
| Monthly Revenue | $10k–50k from their community |
| Team Size | Solo or 1–2 VAs, no dedicated operations person |

### Traffic Sources

- Organic social media (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Twitter/X)
- Some paid ads
- Podcast appearances and collaborations

---

## Current Situation

### What's Working

- Content and audience building is figured out
- Product-market fit exists — people want what they sell
- Revenue is real and consistent

### What's Broken

- Leads come in but fall through the cracks
- Follow-up is manual, slow, and inconsistent
- No unified system — scattered tools and manual effort
- They know they're leaving money on the table but lack time to fix it

---

## Psychology

### Goals

- Convert more existing traffic into paid members without creating more content
- Build leverage — make current efforts work harder
- Install systems that run without constant involvement

### Frustrations

- "I'm getting views but not enough conversions"
- "I don't have time to follow up with everyone"
- "I know I should automate this but I don't know how"
- "I'm stuck doing everything myself"

### Fears

- Automation feeling spammy or inauthentic to their audience
- Wasting money on another tool they won't actually use
- Complexity — they don't want to learn new tech
- Dependence on something that might break

---

## Buying Behavior

### Purchase Triggers

- Just had a viral moment and realized they captured almost nothing from it
- Burned out from manual DMs and follow-up tasks
- Saw a competitor with better systems getting better results
- Hit a revenue plateau and identified the funnel as the bottleneck

### Common Objections

- "Can't I just do this myself with Mailchimp or ConvertKit?"
- "How do I know this will actually move the needle?"
- "Is this going to sound robotic to my audience?"
- "What happens if it breaks — who fixes it?"

### Where They Spend Attention

- Skool communities (as owners and members)
- Twitter/X (creator economy conversations)
- YouTube (learning from other creators)
- TikTok (content consumption and creation)
- Podcasts about creator business and online education

---

## Identification Signals

Use these signals to identify potential customers:

- Appears on Skool leaderboard (public revenue data available)
- Active on social media with engaged audience
- Runs a free Skool community with 500+ members (untapped warm leads)
- Posts content consistently but shows no visible funnel sophistication
- Mentions being overwhelmed or wanting to "systemize" in their content
